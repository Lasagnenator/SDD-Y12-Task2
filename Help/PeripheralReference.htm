<p>It should be noted that a peripheral is not limited to a single peripheral address and can take multiple as seen with the graphics peripheral. It is up to the designer of the peripheral as to how it should work across multiple addresses and it is up to the programmer to make sure that they use the peripheral correctly.</p>
