<h1>Assembler Usage</h1>
<ol>
<li>Run Assembler.exe (Either extract the Assembler.zip or run main.py from the source). Two windows should appear, a black console and a small GUI.</li>
<li>In the GUI, select the input .r16.asm file and the desired output .r16.bin file.</li>
<li>Press Start</li>
<li>If any errors occur, the console will display as many errors as it can about the file. Note: In some cases an error will be the cause of many more errors. When an error occurs, the line number of the offending instruction will be written with&nbsp;parentheses e.g. (200). Modify your source file according to the error displayed and press Start again.</li>
<li>When successful, the console will print out "Success" and the status bar of the GUI will display "Success" as well.</li>
